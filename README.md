# AI and ML Bot with OpenAI APIs and Fine-Tuning

## Project Overview
This project's objective is to develop a machine-learning-based bot specifically designed to assist data science educators by emulating the teaching style of our data science instructor, Drew. It leverages OpenAI's APIs and fine-tuning capabilities to learn from transcripts of recorded classes, enabling it to not only provide contextual assistance and answer frequently asked questions but also to interact and respond in a manner that closely resembles Drew's unique teaching approach, thereby offering a personalized and familiar learning experience to students.

## Features
- **Advanced Contextual Understanding**: Uses OpenAI's models for deep contextual comprehension of data science topics.
- **FAQs and Resource Suggestions**: Answers common questions and recommends resources, leveraging fine-tuned models.
- **Transcript-Informed Learning**: Continuously learns and adapts from class transcripts.
- **Interactive Learning Experience**: Engages students with interactive and responsive discussions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API
- Natural Language Processing Libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech

## How it Works

- **Data Preprocessing**: Transcripts are cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted according to OpenAI's requirements.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The bot is fine-tuned using the processed transcripts on OpenAI's models, enhancing its understanding of data science topics.
- **Inference**: Utilizes the fine-tuned model to interpret and respond to student queries effectively.
