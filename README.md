# Data Science Teacher Assistant Bot with OpenAI Fine-Tuning

## Project Overview
"DataSciTeachBot" is a machine learning bot designed to assist data science educators. It leverages OpenAI's APIs and fine-tuning capabilities to learn from transcripts of recorded classes. This approach enhances the bot's ability to provide contextual assistance, answer FAQs, and suggest tailored resources in the field of data science.

## Features
- **Advanced Contextual Understanding**: Uses OpenAI's models for deep contextual comprehension of data science topics.
- **FAQs and Resource Suggestions**: Answers common questions and recommends resources, leveraging fine-tuned models.
- **Transcript-Informed Learning**: Continuously learns and adapts from class transcripts.
- **Interactive Learning Experience**: Engages students with interactive and responsive discussions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API
- Natural Language Processing Libraries (NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech APIs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataSciTeachBot.git

## How it Works

- **Data Preprocessing**: Transcripts are cleaned, preprocessed, and formatted according to OpenAI's requirements.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The bot is fine-tuned using the processed transcripts on OpenAI's models, enhancing its understanding of data science topics.
- **Inference**: Utilizes the fine-tuned model to interpret and respond to student queries effectively.
